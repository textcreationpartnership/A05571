            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the ryght honourable may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Peter Conterini, gentylman of Vencce, at Rome</head>
            <p>RYghte honourable ſyr, I haue dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers tymes ſyth it hath pleaſed god to trouble me by makynge me to take in hand this enterpriſe of Polone wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to your honour, as to one that both for countreyes ſake, and for our olde acquian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, and alſo for his goodnes doth vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſafe to bee my father and protectour in my great tormentes and troubles, wherin I haue ben wrapped, prayeng you always that it woulde pleaſe you to ayde me with youre authoritie (whyche is ſo greate with our holy fathers holines) that I may be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come out of this helle, and retourne to Rome, or to my church. But all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles paſte are nothyng in reſpecte of thoſe that I suffer at this preſente, the whiche I can not but write vnto you, to thintent that your honour vnderſtanding it, may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to haue compaſſion on my miſfortune, and to doo your vttermoſt to cauſe me to be called home, whiche I beſeeche you on my knees liftyng vp my handes. The new tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiles wherof I write vnto you be theſe.</p>
            <p>The lord Nicholas Raduil Counte Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin of Vilna is doubtles one of the greteſt
<pb facs="tcp:27343:4"/> men of power &amp; authoritie within all the realme of Polone. And as he is alſo one of the chiefeſt that dothe fauour and promote the cauſe of the Lutheria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſo he ſhulde not be. Nowe I being ſuch a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both of nature &amp; ſure iudgement y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I can not (I can not, I ſay) ſuffer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the moſt holy ſea apoſtolike of Rome ſhulde be thus re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in pieces &amp; railed on; as I ſee it euery daye rent &amp; railed on in dede, I determined with my ſelfe no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to diſſemble, but to pull of my viſour, and to write vnto this lorde a playne letter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my mynde without reſpecte.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe to colour y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter the bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, I fayned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one M. Adam Conarſkye ſecretary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinge, had ſaluted me by his letters, &amp; had reherſed many frendely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des on the behalf of his lordſhip. And vpon this occaſion I began my letter, whettyng my wittes, &amp; makynge it as earneſt and as piththy as I coulde poſſible: and I ſente it hym the .21. of February, at whiche time I was at a caſtell of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> archbiſhop of Gnezna called Louitz, where I alſo am at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Theffect of this letter was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed this lorde Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Palatine, how tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the hole realme it was comonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that his lordſhip agreed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therians in all pointes. And I began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſe theym vnto him particularly one by one. And in the ende I exhorted him to giue
<pb facs="tcp:27343:4"/> ouer &amp; leaue theſe hereticall opinions, for otherwiſe God woulde puniſſhe hym. The truth is, I touched all the hole rable of the Lutherans, and ſpake of their doinges, as muche as the greate and inwarde hatred I beare them could expreſſe. For in dede ther is none euill, but it maye be well ſpoken of thoſe villaines. This lord the Counte Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine, who I thought ſeinge my letters ſo true and ſo wel proued with good reaſons, ſhuld haue bene pulled from his practiſyng with the Lutherans, made me ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (right honorable M. Petre) as Martin Luther him ſelfe wold not haue done, I do not ſay, vnto a man in my ſtate (which am neuertheles a miniſter &amp; legate, albeit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of our holy fathers holyneſſe, &amp; of his moſt holy ſea of Rome) but not to any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon perſon wer he neuer ſo vile &amp; miſera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble. I would haue ſent your honour a copy of the ſame anſwer, but to tell you the truth me thought it wold ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to our very great ſhame, if it ſhould be redde. And therfore I tremble for very feare, leaſt by one meanes or other it will he put foorthe in print, and perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce tranſlated into diuers tongues. For I knowe the caſte of theſe heretykes wherwith God is not pleaſed. But it maye pleaſe your honour to heare the reſt.</p>
            <p>Whan I was in the yeare .1548. ioyned in commiſſion with the moſt Reuerende than
<pb facs="tcp:27343:5"/> biſhop of Fano now worthyly a Cardinal &amp; with the Reuerend of good memory, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentinus our holy fathers nuncio or legate in Germany, after the victory that thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had ouer the proteſtantes, to bryng and reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princis &amp; people to the obedience of the ſea apoſtolike (for ſo was the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our ambaſſade, albeit it ſucceded not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proſperouſly, &amp; we reconciled very few) there wer at that tyme priſoners to thempe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rors maieſty Iohn Friderike, Duke &amp; Cur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſter of Saxonie, &amp; Philip Landtgraue of Heſſe. Than I with my right reuerend col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues, as obedient children, accordyng to our inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s gaue counſell to themperor and his moſt noble brother the kyng of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that they ſhuld cauſe thoſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces heades to be openly cut of, as the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders and mainteynours of heretikes.</p>
            <p>For by this meanes and with this terrour an ende at length ſhould haue ben made of all hereſies in Germanye. But their maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties thought it not beſt to folow ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, and therefore, the matters of the ſea Apoſtolike be in that countrey as they be: that is, they were neuer in worſe caſe, and I ſee, they wyll be euery day worſe &amp; worſe. And I hauyng the like commiſſion at this preſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our moſt holy father pope Paul the fourthe, haue often geuen counſaile to this moſt noble king of Polone, exhortyng
<pb facs="tcp:27343:5"/> him that he wold cauſe to be cut of .viii. or x. heades of the moſt chiefe of thoſe that go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſtirre vp this doctrine of the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans in Polone: For this is the right way to kepe the realme cleane from hereſies</p>
            <p>It is true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel to the kinges maieſtie, &amp; I haue vttred it vnto one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in great authoritie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he ſhuld helpe to perſuade him. Nowe ſuche a matter of ſo great importance which wold haue ben kepte ſo ſecrete as euer any was, leaſt it ſhuld brede more enuy &amp; batred vnto the moſt holy vicars of Chriſt, ſuche a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſay, I feare it be diſcloſed &amp; opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode in euery corner. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid lord Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Palatine hath laid it to my charge by his letters: &amp; haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g writen it, it is no doubt but he hath ſpoken it, &amp; wil ſpeke it vnto others.</p>
            <p>Now pleſeth it your honor to conſider, in what caſe I ſtande, and of what mynde I maye be, and whether I haue reaſonable cauſe to deſire to be diſpatched he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Thoſe that be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promoters of theſe hereſies be in a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny &amp; mighty. I haue done what I coulde to ridde the world of them. Truly ther hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no lack on my behalf. What think you thei wil do towards me if I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in their eies? I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loke for non other tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned curſed railed &amp; cried out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if no wors hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greueth me moſt, that they wil go about to ſprede horrible tales abrode
<pb facs="tcp:27343:6"/> againſt our holy fathers holineſſe, not only in Polone, but alſo throughout al Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; wyl ſaye, as their maner is, that theſe be the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels that his holynes wil make: that is, with choppynge of heades, &amp; other ſuch like violences: Yea I vnderſtand they ſpeake it all redy, and wonderfully blow it abrode: wherby I doo perceiue a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; hurt to the doing of thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the moſt Reuerend and noble Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Caraffa hath lately co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto me by his letters, that is, to let them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this their deſire to make a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall councel, is a part and point of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike. And that therfore they ſpeake not nor thinke therof, but tary for a general cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, which his holynes wyl ſhortly make. I ſay in this now am I altogyther occupied, and I thought I myght haue don ſome good in deferrynge and prolongynge the tyme, as his holynes deſyre is: but the matter beyng diſcloſed (as I haue ſayd before) I can not ſe but al men be againſt me, no man wyl here me, all mens myndes are alienate from me and vtterly ſet againſt me. In ſomuch (to be ſhort) wer it not for theſe moſt reuerend fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſpecially this moſt Reuerend father, the ſaid Archbiſhop, who is my ſainctuary, I could not tell where to ſaue my lyfe, they ſpeake ſo muche euyl of me. And whan thei haue nothyng to talk of, than they go about
<pb facs="tcp:27343:6"/> ſaying, thei know for what cauſe I can not be made cardinal: as thogh I ſhuld be a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry with God for that it hath pleſed him I ſhuld be born out of lauful matrimony. I am con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it hath pleſed him to make me to be born a chriſten man, and therfore I paſſe not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that other. But this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth me excedyngly to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that ther goth about a certain letter printed in diuers tongues, wherein bicauſe I was aſſiſtent to the moſt reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of good memory Cardinall Creſcentius y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Legate in the councel of Trent, al thyng is imputed to me &amp; my counſel that was done in the ſame councel of Trent, and ſpecially that audience was not geuen to the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, as in dede it was not mete nor ought to be. For I confeſſe, that I haue alwayes ben of this opinion, that he which is out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, ought not to be admitted to ſpeak of matters of the churche. But thoſe that vnderſtand it on the contrary part, whan I ſhall ſpeake any more of the holdynge of a generall councell, will out of all peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſay to my face, that we mynd to make it ſuche a Councel as he counſailed &amp; labou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red to be don at Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: that is not to here the other parte. Your honour with your noble brethern M. Franciſce (the light of the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon welth of Venece) and M. Paule made ſo much of, and gaue ſo muche honor vnto our holy fathers holynes, when he was a
<pb facs="tcp:27343:7"/> barefooted Frier at Venece, that his holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes beyng moſt myndfull and thankfull I knowe, is deſirous alſo to requite and doo you pleaſure agayne. Wherfore I hartily beſeche your honour let it ſtande with your pleaſure to beſtowe one droppe of the fauor that ye are in, and cauſe me to bee rydde out of theſe troubles and daungers. And it may pleaſe his holynes to vnderſtand, that it is to no purpoſe for me to haue the doyng of thynges here any longer, for the greate hatred that I haue already purchaſed me. Let his holynes conſyder whether it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſend one to ſupply my place, or to leue this realme without any Legate, which in myne opinion were beſt, bicauſe he can not be here any longer with honor &amp; eſtimation</p>
            <p>Moreouer I think, that when that ſhalbe done, and is done, yet theſe men wil haue it after their owne fantaſy, and there wyll be a great ſciſme, ſo that the nobilitie will fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one way and one doctrine, and the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops an other. And yet I can tell you, not all the byſhops, for one part of them begyn to halte, and a lyttel thyng will make them agree with the Counte Palatine (of whom I write) and the others. But lette his holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doo, as it pleaſeth hym, in ſendynge or not ſendyng an other Legate to ſupply my place, ſo he diſpatche me hence, &amp; that quick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. Who can ſee, who can ſuffer, that at the
<pb facs="tcp:27343:7"/> Shroftide, diſguyſynges, maſkes, &amp; mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meries of monkes, fryers, and Cardinals, ſhulde be openly made, to the open ſhame &amp; reproche of all the hole order of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, as there hath ben here in my time? And who can diſgeſt theſe troubles, theſe villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and not thynke vppon the daunger of his lyfe? Muche good doo it hym: ſurely I aknowlage my ſelfe to be a manne that can not doo it. And I haue no hope that I ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be hable hereafter to do any good here. To be playn I haue done as muche as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſible for me to doo, to lette the diet and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that ſhalbe kept at Bartilmew tide: But yet notwithſtandynge it will procede. Neither ſhal it auaile to waſt my braines &amp; deſtroy my body, ſuffring my ſelf to be toſt from place to place in Couche, in company of the ſaid moſt reuerende Archbiſhop tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all the greater and the leſſe Polone, and ſo to haue brought to paſſe, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kyng hath geuen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the determinacion &amp; concluſion of the laſt parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as I aduertiſed our holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers holynes, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great grudging of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. Beſides I fear leſt theſe felowes ſhal cauſe men to come out of Germany, &amp; ſpecially out of Schwitzerland half a doſin of the greateſt clerkes &amp; moſt famous diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be ther, bicauſe it is bruted abrode, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pope mynded to ſende of his diuines
<pb facs="tcp:27343:8"/> to this parliament to defend our cauſe. And all be it I haue bothe ſayd and earneſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in euery place, that they ſhulde not thinke, that his holynes will euer ſende or conſent to any ſuch parliament, which ſhal be none other but a nationall councell. Yet neuertheles as farre as I can vnderſtand, they mynd to cauſe of our enemies, diuines of other contreys to come hither: Your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may conſider, what confections theſe men wil make, and what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultations and concluſions they wyll determyne agaynſts vs. God helpe vs, for I ſe the matters be in a very euyll caſe.
